> "All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us."

### What is it?

Wizardry is a browser game made with React. You're able to create an account which is linked to your wizard.

### Creating your wizard

Click "Create Account" from the main menu to get to the character creation page.

Put in the email address you want associated with your account. This is how you will log in. 

When creating your wizard you can choose youe name, house, and avatar. There are four houses to choose from: fire, water, earth, and air. The house you choose will determine the spells available to you. 

You must then click on the avatar you want.

### How to play

Once logged in, when you are ready, choose which stage you want to try first. We recommend going in order from left to right. 

Every spell has a different power value that is unknown to the player. The chosen spells value is added to your wizards **_Strength_** and the sum of the two numbers will determine if you can defeat the monster. Each stage's monster has a **_Strength_** value that you can see in the main page, before choosing a stage. 

If you fail to defeat a monster, you lose 20 strength and are sent back to the main page. 

You have time to cast about two spells before the monster is upon you, tearing you to shreds...

The goal is to reach a **_Strength_** of at least **_400_**. At this point your wizard transcends to a superhuman like state and the game is over. What you do with this power is your choice...
